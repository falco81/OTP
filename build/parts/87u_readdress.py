# ---- a node's address changed: the cluster put right in place (1.0.106) ----------
# Replication remembers the other node's address in three places on each node:
# config.json (ha_peer, and ha_address - its own, as the other reaches it), its
# subscription's connection, and the line of pg_hba.conf that lets the other
# node in. Changing an address used to mean taking the pair apart and building
# it again. Now one node is told the new address(es) - on its pages or with
# otp --ha-readdress - and puts its three places right; then it tells the other
# node straight into that one's database, which does its part by itself.
#
# Which node to do it on: the one whose address did NOT change. Its own line
# in the other's pg_hba.conf still matches, so it can reach the other at the
# new address and tell it; the other cannot reach it yet. When both changed,
# do it on both (each says what it could not do).
