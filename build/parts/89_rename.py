# From opt to otp (1.0.37): the database's own names
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Until 1.0.37 this program was called opt, and so were the database and the
# account it made, and its replication. install.sh --upgrade moves the files,
# folders and system accounts; this (otp --rename-from-opt, as root) does the
# databases on this machine:
#
#   * PostgreSQL here: the database opt and the account opt are renamed otp,
#     and pg_hba.conf with them;
#   * MariaDB here: the tables are moved into a database otp, the account is
#     renamed and given that database;
#   * replicated: the publication, this node's subscription, and the slot on
#     this node with the other node's subscription to it - renamed without a
#     row lost: the other node's subscription is paused, the slot copied
#     under its new name at the same place, the subscription pointed at it
#     (and at the renamed database and account), resumed, and the old slot
#     dropped. Whichever node goes first, the second finishes the job.
#
# A database on another machine is left as it is (that takes its own
# administrator): its names are written into config.json, so nothing breaks.
