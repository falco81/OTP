"""otp_upgrade.py - a new version of otp, put in by root (1.0.37).

The pages cannot upgrade anything themselves: the service runs as `otp`,
which may not write a byte of the program. What it may do is lay a package
down in /var/lib/otp/upgrade/ and ask for it with request.json; systemd
(otp-upgrade.path) sees the request and starts otp-upgrade.service, which
runs this as root. This then trusts nothing it was handed:

  * the package is copied to a folder of root's own before anything is read
    from it, so it cannot be changed under the check;
  * it must be signed: MANIFEST lists the SHA-256 of every file, and
    MANIFEST.sig is the Ed25519 signature of MANIFEST by one of the keys in
    /usr/local/lib/otp/release-keys/ - which only root can write, and which
    only a package installed by root (install.sh, or this) puts there;
  * every file in it is listed in MANIFEST with the right hash, nothing more,
    no links, no device, no path outside its one folder;
  * it is not older than the version installed (the same one again is a
    retry and is allowed).

Then its own install.sh --upgrade --yes is run, exactly as somebody would
on the command line, and what it said is written back for the pages.

  otp_upgrade.py                 serve request.json (as root, from systemd)
  otp_upgrade.py --inspect FILE  check a package and say what it is (JSON);
                                 any user - the daemon asks this way
  otp_upgrade.py --run FILE      check and put in a package by hand (root)
