# otp

A one-time password server for a VPN.

A Cisco ASA (or anything else that speaks RADIUS) asks it whether a person
may in. otp answers RADIUS itself, checks the six-digit code from the
person's phone (TOTP, RFC 6238), looks the person up in Active Directory,
checks their groups, and sends back Access-Accept with whatever the VPN
should be told - a Class, a group policy - or Access-Reject with the reason.

People make their own token on a web page: they sign in with their directory
password, scan a QR code, keep their recovery codes and prove it worked with
a code. Administrators look after everything else on pages of their own.

It is the replacement for a totpcgi + totpcgi-provisioning + FreeRADIUS 2 +
Perl handler server, and it brings such a server over whole - every token
keeps working, nobody enrols again. It writes its logs in the very shape that
server wrote them, so isemon reads it with what it already has.

One Python file, the standard library, and PHP pages that only relay to it.
No FreeRADIUS, no totpcgi, no qrencode, no pip packages (a driver only for
MariaDB or PostgreSQL, if you choose one of those).

```
    otp --status                    what it is doing, in one screen
    otp --log                       the RADIUS requests, newest first
    otp --rejects                   ...only the refused ones, with the reason
    otp --request 42                one request, every attribute and every step
    otp --otp-log                   every check of a code
    otp --tokens                    everybody who has a token
    otp --enroll novak@example.cz   a token, with the QR code in the terminal
    otp --radtest novak 123456      ask it the way radtest does, from here
    otp --directory-user AD novak   what the directory says about somebody
    otp --isemon-test               a line to isemon, to see that it arrives
```

`otp` is the same command, for those who type the server's name - and `otp` with nothing
after it says what it is doing. The daemon itself is `otp --daemon` (systemd starts it).

And the real thing, from anywhere a client is allowed:

```
    radtest falco 135830 otp.example.local 1812 testing123
```

## What is in it

| | |
|---|---|
| RADIUS | RFC 2865/2866, Status-Server (RFC 5997), Message-Authenticator on every answer and, per client, required on every request (BlastRADIUS, CVE-2024-3596); duplicate detection; accounting written down |
| codes | TOTP/HOTP (RFC 6238/4226), SHA-1/256/512, 6-8 digits, a window for clock drift that is recorded per token, a code used once only, a pause after wrong codes, recovery codes kept as hashes |
| realms | what comes after the @: which directory, how the name is looked up (UPN / sAMAccountName), which groups let in (nested groups too), whether the password is the code, the directory password then the code, or the directory password alone, and what goes back - per group |
| Active Directory | LDAPS / StartTLS / plain, several domain controllers in order, its own CA certificate, a read-only service account, disabled and expired accounts refused, a check that says which step failed |
| enrolment | the user's own pages: sign in, scan, recovery codes, confirm with a code, replace a lost phone with the password and a code from the old token or a recovery code |
| administration | overview, tokens, every RADIUS request with every step of its decision, every check of a code, a radtest from the page, events, and every setting - the same pages as isemon |
| isemon | `totp.cgi` and `radius-detail` syslog lines exactly as totpcgi and FreeRADIUS wrote them, over UDP or TCP, and the same lines in files here |
| mail | a new token's QR code (and, if asked, its recovery codes) mailed to its owner in Czech or English - through your mail server (STARTTLS/SMTPS/none; PLAIN, LOGIN, CRAM-MD5, XOAUTH2 or no sign-in) or straight to the recipient's MX; its own CA certificates |
| export | tokens out as totpcgi .totp files - all, a search, or one - for totpcgi or another otp |
| databases | SQLite (a file here), MariaDB, PostgreSQL; the token keys sealed with a key kept beside the database |
| languages | English and Czech, chosen per person; isemon's language files and engine |
